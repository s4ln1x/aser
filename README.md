# Awesome Software Engineering Resources

This project is intended to be a foundational base of all the topics I would
like to learn or I believe are convenient to learn for the future, this is
just base on my opinion of what is going to be useful to know, so you should
take it with a grain of salt, I just wanted to share it with everyone to see
if this could help somebody, all the material on paper I feel is worth it, but
of course you should learn just what you like or need and nothing else.

As a final comment **NOT** all the resources are supposed to be free.

Any feedback is always welcomed...!!!
